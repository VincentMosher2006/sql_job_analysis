Results: Many of the highest‑paying skills are workflow and collaboration tools like Asana, Airtable, Slack, Notion, and Zoom, which are used for project management, team coordination, and cross‑functional communication.

Several niche programming languages—such as Elixir, Lua, Haskell, and Objective‑C—appear near the top because they’re used for high‑performance systems, backend services, and specialized application development, where talent is scarce.

Data and ML‑focused tools like BigQuery, Airflow, DynamoDB, Hugging Face, and Theano show strong salaries due to their roles in data engineering pipelines, large‑scale storage, and modern machine learning workflows.

Frameworks like Ruby on Rails, RShiny, and Unity highlight demand for web development, data visualization, and interactive application design in high‑impact roles.
